# CS471-Final

python3 -m http.server http://localhost:8000/index.html

This project is split into two parts:

SPRITES:
Sprites features two penguins with random positions and velocities who fly around the screen. When they run into each other, they produce an alert before flying in opposite directions. This satisfies the 'C' portion of the final.

BOIDS:
Boids features a flocking simulation utilizing Cohesion, Seperation, and Alignment. Unfortunately, it is extremely bare bones and is also heavily inspired from the algorithm featured in The Coding Train's Flocking Simulation video (https://youtu.be/mhjuuHl6qHM). Because of this, I am treating this as more of a just 'here is what I learned' more than anything else. You may find various artifacts of other features I was playing around with as well as some that actually did make it through, like the RBG background.

Was crunched for time due to graduation stuff these 2 weeks but am glad I got the opportunity to work with this. If I have any time in the coming days I may even make a fork to continue playing with the boids a little more!

Once again, thank you for the amazing semester! You were undoubtedly my favorite professor and it was an honor to learn under you!
